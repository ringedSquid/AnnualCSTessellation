## How to use?
Running ```main.py``` will open a turtle window and the tesselation will be generated, covering the entire window area. 

You can change the parameters passed to the main function:
```python3
main(i, d, c=[(0, 0, 0)])
#i = size of each piece
#d = amount of divisions within each piece (MUST BE AN EVEN NUMBER)
#c = RGB color tuple (0 - 1)


```
